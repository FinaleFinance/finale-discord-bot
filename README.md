# Finale Finance Discord Bot
The Finale Finance Discord bot is designed to supply ETH for testing the protocol on Testnet. Its primary function is to execute the faucet command which sends ETH to a specified Ethereum address. This command can only be utilized once every 24 hours by each user.

After a successful transaction, the user is granted a "Pathfinder" role on the Finale Finance Discord server.

## Discord Command
The bot provides the `faucet` command with the following structure:

### `/faucet <ethereum-address>`
#### Parameters
- `<ethereum-address>`: The Ethereum address where the ETH will be sent.
#### Example

`/faucet 0x3Dc6D...AbC123`

Please replace `0x3Dc6D...AbC123` with your actual Ethereum address.

## Interacting with the Bot
To interact with the bot, join the Finale Finance Discord server and navigate to the faucet channel. Execute the faucet command along with your Ethereum address to initiate a faucet transaction. Ensure that you have entered a valid Ethereum address to avoid errors.

Remember, you can only use the `faucet` command once every 24 hours. Successful transactions will grant you the "Pathfinder" role on the server.

Please remember to follow all community guidelines when interacting on the Discord server. Enjoy your time with the Finale Finance!
